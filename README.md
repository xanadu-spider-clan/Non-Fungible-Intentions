# What intention do you bring to the Cardano Metaverse?

The metaverse is here. What will you bring to it?

## Your task:
Place your intention on the permanent ledger by submitting Cardano transaction metadata at the key **12586269025**

## How to do it: 

### If you know how to add metadata to a Cardano transaction
1. Go for it!
2. Just make sure that you use the key 12586269025

### If you know someone who can help, then ask them for help
1. There are people here this weekend who can help you.
2. Ask a new friend if they know how to add metadata to a transaction and if they won't mind helping you.

### If you'd like to try something on your own
1. Go to https://gamechanger.finance/
2. Create a wallet. GameChanger wallet is in beta and requires you to **use your mnemonics every time you log in**. (It won't be like this forever, but it's a tool that works for now if the options above don't work for you.)
3. Fund your Gamechanger Wallet with just a little bit of ada: 1.5 ada will be plenty for what we're doing today.
4. On the left-hand navigation menu, click "Playground"
5. At the top of the Playground page, choose "Edit Code"
6. From the Demos dropdown menu, choose "Metadata" > "Hello World"
7. Change the Metadata Key from "123" to "12586269025"
8. Replace the Message with your own answer to the question, "What intention are you bringing to the Cardano Metaverse?" 
    - This message is limited to 64 characters in length.
    - You should be replacing the text "Hello World of transaction metadata!"
9. When you're ready, click Preview
10. Then click the green Execute button

What you've just done is sent a transaction to yourself. You only spent the transaction fee of ~0.17, so your balance will now be 0.17 less than you originally funded.
